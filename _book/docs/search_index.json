The course starts from the peak of the testing pyramid and goes down instead of following the \"standard\" testing path, you can read here the reason why. Some introductory slides are also included but they're only useful for the teacher, they're a summary of the content presented before the coding session.\n\nAdditional requisites to run the project and the tests on your local machine:\n\nNode.js 10+\nMongoDB\nDocker\n\n"},"book/course-description.html":{"url":"book/course-description.html","title":"Course description","keywords":"","body":"Course description\nJavascript Testing, a Practical Approach\nBeing able to test components and web-apps developed with React is an increasingly important requirement for a front-end developer. There are tools and libraries that simplify the testing process but the learning curve can seem daunting.\n\n\"What’s the right way to start testing my web applications?\"\n\"It’s unclear what I'm supposed to test (and what not) and how to do it\"\n\"My current tests fail all the time and don't help me preventing new bugs\"\n\nDoes this sound familiar?\nThis course aims to provide basic information, principles and experience-based advices, to enter the world of testing methodologies.\nTesting your own web applications is much easier and more profitable than you might think. Even if some advances concepts and benefits may only become evident in the medium to long run this course serves the purpose to overcome the initial obstacles and understand how to take actions and leverage the benefits of testing immediatetely .\nDuring the day, we will see all the useful tests for a web-app developed with React, dealing with the typical cases we encounter on a daily basis. During this course we will teach you:\n\nThe best practices to follow to write useful and lasting tests\nHow to test different user flows without a working back-end\nHow to write effective end-to-end tests (E2E)\nHow to integrate tests into development and Continuous Integration pipelines\n\nWe will alternate theoretical explanations with live coding sessions, at the end of the course the source code of all the exercises, the material used for explanations, and other in-depth materials will be made available.\nTopics:\n\nTest panorama\nWhat is an E2E test\nBrowser automation\nPros and cons of E2E tests vs UI integration tests\n\n\nCypress\nThe Test Runner\nAutomatic waitings\nAutomatic screenshots e videos\nAsynchronous execution\n\n\nCypress as your main development browser\nBest practices\nHow to identify DOM elements\nWaitings instead of pauses, what deterministic events are\nThe right use of the assertions\n\n\nWhy the tests must be as simple as possible\nUsefulness for all the team members\nNaming conventions and dedicated scripts\nMonitoring tests\n\n\nCypres advanced use\nCustom commands\n\n\nVisual Regression Testing for the whole web app\nContinuous Integration\n\nAttendees\nThis course is for all the developers who have already worked with React but have not yet started, or have not yet succeeded in testing their React web applications. At the end of the course, you will be able to apply the fundamental principles of the test methodologies to understand what and how to test effectively.\nParticipation requirements\nTo participate it is necessary, or at least strongly recommended, that you already know the basic concepts behind React: JSX, the components, and their status, lifecycle events, user interaction management.\n"},"book/about-me.html":{"url":"book/about-me.html","title":"About me","keywords":"","body":"About me\n\nStefano Magni\nI'm a passionate and positive-minded Senior Front-end Engineer, a Speaker, and an Instructor from Italy (working remotely since 2018).

Writing the test some days after the code is useless, you probably forgot half of the choices you made (choices that you need to test)\n\na failing test is a good thing, really! Because it has protected us from a regression! The important thing is that...\n\n... The tests should not fail for randomly. False-negative tests are the worst ones, you do not know why they fail and you stop trusting them\n\nobviously, the opposite is important too: tests must fail if the app does not work, otherwise, what are they testing?\n\ntests must be simple. Simple to be read, understood, and changed. Tests must be an ally, simple scripts that perform some checks for you. Complex and unclear tests are an enemy, you write some tests to allow yourself to refactor the code, you can not spend all your time refactoring the tests. And remember that... (read the Avoid Nesting when you're Testing article of Kent C. Dodds)\n\n... Debugging a failing test is way harder than debugging an application\n\ndo not DRY the test code too early. While testing, you need to change more or less every line of the test code to simulate the different cases. Applying DRY when not necessary increases the test complexity and makes you add a lot of conditions to the DRYed code\n\navoid conditional tests as much as you can, the test code must be straightforward\n\na failing test must give useful feedback. It must tell you what failed and why, without re-launching or debugging it\n\ntests must be deterministic: if you run them a hundred times, the result must be the same. If they are not deterministic, you must think about what influences them and how to write better tests\n\ndeterministic tests also mean that you should not rely on their execution order. Otherwise, you have extremely brittle tests that need to be run in a specific order\n\nthe test must fail before you write the code and succeed when you have written the code. Otherwise, you can not be sure that the test is testing your code and that is your code that gets it to succeed. If you are fixing a bug, you could neither be sure you have systematically reproduced it. You risk having a useless test and a false sense of confidence\n\ntests must be fast, as fast as possible. You should never sacrifice speed for reliability, but the speed is really important because the faster the tests are, the faster you have feedback, the higher the chance you run them frequently, the sooner you discover regressions. Slow tests make you move your mind to another task, make you waste your time, make you angry when they fail after a 30-minutes pipeline, and, sooner or later, You will start wondering about removing them...\n\nnever do white-box testing. You have to test APIs, contracts, and behaviors, not internal details. You must test as the consumer, not as the author (Testing Implementation Details by Kent C. Dodds)\n\ntests failing because of some slight code changes are fragile and should be avoided\n\ntests must be independent from each other, they must not share any state\n\nyou cannot manually interact with the tests. It's easier when doing functional tests but it's a generic rule, the tests must not depend on human changes\n\ndifferent test types provide different feedback and have different cost, get used with that. Following the black-box testing rule, an E2E test can not provide useful feedback for a single function, and a unit test can not tell you if your app works\n\ncode coverage helps us find what we have not tested yet, it is not an end in itself\n\nif you're not enough confident about your application (you are not sure that it works even if the tests pass), think twice about your tests. Why they do not give you enough confidence? How could you improve them?\n\ndon't underestimate skip and only test utilities, these are super useful to run a portion of the tests and remove unnecessary noise\n\nyou should not test external services, you should test how you consume them, not if they work or not\n\nyou should not test third party scripts and libraries\n\nyou should not test native APIs\n\nlast but not least: always remember that testing and TDD are two different things.

Everything is new, the examples you try to implement do not work, debugging a test could be hard...\nWe think that approaching a test suite from the bottom to the top does not help.

It checks everything: from the user interactions (one of the \"end\") to the business data (the other \"end\"): everything must work as designed.\nE2E tests are typically slow because:\n\nthey need a working back-end application. You can not launch the E2E tests without a server so you, as a front-end developer, depend on the back-end developers and infrastructure to work.\n\nThe back-end could be:\n\nlaunched alongside the front-end application. A mirror of the back-end is up and running, typically in a Docker container, the database is empty and you need to seed it with the data that you need in order to replicate the various scenario\nexists externally from the container where the tests are run. The data could already exist in the database but you need to get them pristine before every test, because the tests need always the same data to be effective\n\n\nthey depend on the resources the back-end can leverage. But it's common to have limited back-end resources for the non-production environment, for example\n\nthey depend on the network. Everything that could affect the network is going to affect the tests too\n\nthey need a lot of reliable data. The tests must be deterministic (do not forget about the testing rules) and so, they need always the same data\n\n\nAn important note: the front-end application is not deployed in advance and then tested. Instead, it needs to be built on the fly, launched (usually with Docker) and then, if the tests pass, the new front-end app is going to be deployed. That's how the CI/CD pipelines work.\nWhat flows should be tested E2E?\n\nthe Happy Path flows: you need to be sure that, at least, the users are able to complete the basic operations\n\neverything valuable for your business: happy path or not, test whatever your business cares about (prioritizing them, obviously)\n\neverything that breaks often: weak areas of the system must be checked too\n\n\nIn the next examples we are going to write some E2E tests and to understand why they are not feasible to be used as the only/main test type.

We are going to discover why looking at the markup of the signup form (here the local one and the online hosted one):\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Sign up\n    \n  \n\n\nThe three input fields are pretty identical except for:\n\nthe order: we know that the email field comes first, then the email and password fields\n\nthe type: text, email and password\n\nthe placeholder\n\nother ideas?...\n\n\nOrder of elements\nPlease note: the following is not the best E2E test on earth, you are going to discover why step by step &#x1F609;\nThe Cypress test could be the following\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\ncy.get is the Cypress command you leverage to consume a DOM element in the test. Please note that, as the documentation says:\n\nThe querying behavior of this command matches exactly how $(…) works in jQuery.\n\nIt sounds strange to leverage JQuery nowadays... But do not forget one of the testing rules: the test must be simple. The less code the test is made of, the more the test is readable and understandable. And JQuery surely improves both the simplicity and productivity.\nWhat about the following snippet\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => ... is necessary because almost every Cypress command must be leveraged asynchronously (we are going to learn why with the Cypress waitings and execution order)\n\n$els, like every JQuery selector, is an array containing all the DOM elements that respond to the given selector (.form-control)\n\ncy.get($els[]) select the element and .type(\"Tester\") types, as the user would do, into the input field\n\n\nThen, we can go ahead and click the button\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\n\ncy.get(\"button\").click() speaks for itself\n\n\"No articles are here... yet.\" is the string that the home page shows when the signup flow ends. After successful registration, the user is redirected to the home page, the \"Your Feed\" does not contain any posts yet. Think about it as the proof that everything worked (while testing the signup flow, obviously)\n\n\n\n\nthe cy.contains() API gets the DOM element containing the text\n\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\") gets the DOM element containing the text \"No articles are here\"\n\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\"); asserts about the element itself. This is the end of our test, we want to be sure that the text is visible because it means that the test is finished, the signup flow has worked! (if you want to know more about the available assertions, take a look at the official documentation)\n\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot above, the test worked! &#x1F389;\nNow: are we sure that the test follows the testing rules? This test is neither deterministic nor stable nor useful if it fails! The next chapters are going to explain the reasons why.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/cypress-waitings-and-execution-order.html":{"url":"book/cypress-waitings-and-execution-order.html","title":"Cypress waitings and execution order","keywords":"","body":"Cypress waitings and execution order\nIn the previous chapter, we've written this initial test\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nWithout noting it, we've leveraged some interesting features of Cypress.\nAutomatic waiting\nThis is a mind-blowing feature: did you notice that the test seems a synchronous flow? Think about what happens between a command and the next one:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\n// what does \"visit\" mean? When is Cypress going to execute the next commands? Is JavaScript ready?\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  // typing is an asynchronous task, when will the next task start?\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  // the web app makes an AJAX call, a lot of time passes before the \"No articles are here\" text becomes visible\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWell: in every UI test, everything is asynchronous. The JavaScript execution is asynchronous, the DOM update is asynchronous, the actions of the user are asynchronous... A synchronous approach is a failure by definition.\nMost of the existing browser automation tools (like Selenium or Puppeteer) force you to manually manage a lot of asynchronous situations, while Cypress is asynchronous at its core (read more about a detailed comparison with the Await, do not make your E2E tests sleep post). Cypress has been created with UI testing in mind.\nAutomatic waitings are so important because:\n\nthey allow you to do not care about a lot of asynchronous updates\n\nthey make the test as fast as possible, avoiding fixed (and slow, and brittle) test pauses (we are going to deepen the topic in the next chapters)\n\n\nAnswering the questions added as comments to the above snippet:\n\ncy.visit waits for the window dispatches the load event\n\nevent if typing is a \"long\" task (every letter is typed one by one) the next command is not executed until the typing ends\n\nCypress retries cy.contains, cy.get, and other commands by default. The commands have customizable timeout and when Cypress is not able to find the requested elements, they are retried until the elements are added to the page (or throw an error if the timeout is not respected). You can read everything about Cypress retry-ability in the official documentation\n\n\nTest Runner interactivity\nThe Test Runner shows you what's happening in the front-end application, every executed Cypress command, and the result of all the assertions. And it's interactive, too! Take a look at the following video\n\n\nit shows how the Test Runner allows you to \"time travel\" the various phases and check the state of the front-end before and after the execution of every command. As usual, take a look at the Test Runner documentation to discover more about it.\nTest code execution order\nThat's the weird thing you need to get used with Cypress. As we told in advance, every Cypress command is asynchronous by default. That means that Cypress executes the test code twice:\n\nthe first time Cypress executes the test code to read and queue all the commands it needs to execute\n\nthen Cypress loads the page, and executes, one by one, all the command previously queued\n\n\nEven the commands execution order is not what could seem at a first sight. Try changing the test code to\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-   cy.get(\"button\").click();\n-   cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n+ cy.get(\"button\").click();\n+ cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nRun the test and you will see that nothing changes. That's because, independently from the nesting level, Cypress waits for the previous commands (like cy.get($els[2]).type(\"...\")) to be completed before running the next ones (like cy.get(\"button\").click();). This unique feature allows writing more readable tests.\nThe downside is that you can not leverage commands returning variables the way you expect. Something like\nconst button = cy.get(\"button\");\nbutton.click(); // nope\n\nwill not work as expected. Every Cypress command yields a value and you must .then() it to consume the value.\ncy.get(\"button\").then($button => button.click());\n// or simply\ncy.get(\"button\").click();\n\nthe latter is possible because every command is executed on the previous yielded value/subject.\nLast but not least: commands can be chained on the cy object:\ncy.visit(\"/register\");\ncy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n  cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n  cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n  cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"button\").click();\n  cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n// is equivalent to\ncy.visit(\"/register\")\n  .get(\".form-control\")\n  .then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0])\n      .type(\"Tester\")\n      .get($els[1])\n      .type(\"user@realworld.io\")\n      .get($els[2])\n      .type(\"mysupersecretpassword\")\n      .get(\"button\")\n      .click();\n  });\ncy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n\nYou can choose the syntax you're more comfortable with. Read more about the asynchronicity nature of Cypress in the official documentation.\n\np.s. out of curiosity: you can log the Cypress queued commands with a slight change to the code\n-it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+it(\"The happy path should work\", function() {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n    cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n    cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n    cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n+   console.log(this.test.commands);\n  });\n});\n\nThat's the result\n\nread here why you need to use the standard function() {} syntax instead of the arrow function () => {} syntax.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html":{"url":"book/e2e-test-defects-determinism.html","title":"Determinism","keywords":"","body":"Main E2E test defects\nDeterminism\nCome back to the very first signup E2E test\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(\"Tester\");\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(\"user@realworld.io\");\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThis test has a lot of problems, first of all: it's not deterministic (its behavior is not the same every time we launch it).

The following ones\n\nthe button does not trigger the right Redux action\nthe functions that manage the authentication do not do the expected job\n\ncould be listed in the so-called \"implementation details\". We're testing the whole front-end application from an outer perspective, not from an inner one. We are testing that the user signup works, not how the signup works (React is an implementation detail by Kent C. Dodds).\nA more practical example: if you need to test that pushing the accelerator get the car move, you push the accelerator and you check that... the car move! If the accelerator is a wired or electronic one does not matter! You will test the connection between the accelerator and the engine with other types of test.\nRemember that the subject under test must be treated as a black box (see the testing rules). About the signup flow: we are not testing why the form component do not receive the right dispatch prop or why it does not call it. We are just checking that the form works and allows the user to register! Do the users care about Redux actions? No! They just want to register!\nError feedback\nImagine this scenario: you're working at a new feature. You have inadvertently broken the signup flow and you discover that as soon as you run the existing E2E tests. Tests can fail, it happens! Tests are not meant to be always green, they are meant to help us discover regressions as soon as possible! Apart from failing, what have we broken in the signup flow? Is the test useful to identify what we need to fix?\nTake a look at the feedback the Test Runner gives us for all the above-listed errors.\n\n\n\nError\nTest Runner feedback\nIs it useful?\n\n\n\n\n1. the host does not work\n\n✅\n\n\n2. the page does not respond\n\n⚠️\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n❌\n\n\n4. the button is not rendered\n\n✅️\n\n\nAll the remaining errors:6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n❌\n\n\n\nTake the most useless two errors and inverting the comparison, do you think that the feedback on the first column allows you to understand what happened (the second column)? &#x1F914;\n\n\n\nTest Runner feedback\nError\n\n\n\n\n\n3. one of the input fields is not rendered\n\n\n\nOne of 6. the AJAX call does not start7. the AJAX call has the wrong request payload8. the API does not work and it does not respond9. the API returns the wrong payload11. the user already exists12. everything is managed correctly but the redirect to the home does not work13. the home page does not show the \"No articles are here\" text14. the home page shows a slight different message to the user\n\n\n\nThe answert is obviously No. The errors in the table tell us nothing about what happened.\nStuff to do in case of failures\nIt's not only about utility but also about preventing useless and long debugging processes. How do you proceed when a test fails? Usually you:\n\nread the logs of the tests\n\nlook for the failing test and read the output error\n\nit the output speaks for itself you can fix the regression you introduces, otherwise, you open the test file\n\nidentify the failing test and you run only it (if you have violated the \"tests must not share the state\" rule you are going to waste a lot of time at this step)\n\nre-run the test looking at the web app\n\nbased on the error\n\nif the error is a \"visual one\" (something not rendered etc.) you know where do you have to check 1\nIf the error is not visual one (wrong DOM selectors, wrong AJAX payloads, etc.) you need to open the DevTools, re-run the test, inspect the DOM or the network activities, etc. until you find the error itself\n\n\n\nIt's a ton of work! The test we're talking about is not helpful at all! It has no meaningful feedback and it requires you debugging it (remember: debugging a test is harder than debugging a standard script/app) on failure. These are the basis for test blaming, hate and exclusion. Always remember: if you are blaming the tests, you must stop and re-think them. Go ahead to re-think the E2E test.\n\nFootnotes:\n1: for visual errors, a look at the screenshots and videos that Cypress saves automatically could be enough.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/dom-elements-selection.html":{"url":"book/dom-elements-selection.html","title":"data-testid","keywords":"","body":"data-testid\nWe managed to have a deterministic event test like the following\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-2.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    });\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nbut, as we've seen, one of the defects of the above test is its uselessness while something goes wrong by retrieving the elements to interact with.\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe HTML of the form is the following\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Sign up\n    \n  \n\n\nIf we want to avoid basing the test on the order, we can leverage\n\nthe type: text, email, and password\n\nthe placeholder\n\n\nThe test could become the following\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n-    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n-      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n-      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n-      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n-      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-    });\n+   const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=text]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n+   cy.get(\"[type=password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nor, leveraging the placeholder\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n-    cy.get(\".form-control\").then($els => {\n-      const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n-      cy.get($els[0]).type(`Tester${random}`);\n-      cy.get($els[1]).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n-      cy.get($els[2]).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n-    });\n+   const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Username]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n+   cy.get(\"[placeholder=Password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"button\").click();\n    cy.contains(\"No articles are here\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nBoth of them work as expected when everything is ok, but if the email input field is not rendered they allow us to understand what's wrong\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\nYou get the same feedback if you run Cypress through cypress run (most of the times you'll find broken tests in the terminal or reading the logs)\n\nWhat not to do\nForget for a while the RealWorld form, there are a ton of selectors we can use when finding DOM elements, but most of them could change because of different purposes (and then break the test inadvertently):\n\n\n\nSelector\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nclasses\nStyle\n\n\nids\nJavaScript\n\n\nHTML tags\nstandardization/SEO\n\n\ntype\nUser experience\n\n\nARIA attributes\nUser experience\n\n\n\nThese selectors do not have testing purposes, the more the tests use them, the more they're fragile. You could not blame yourself or a colleague of your when, after 20 minutes of watching the pipeline and debugging the app, you discover that the test broke because of a class is changed. The problem is not in the web app, the problem is in the test.\nYou need to use a dedicated attribute, one that will not change because of other needs, and this is data-testid (or data-test, or data-cy, etc.).

The feedback in case of failure is almost the same as the previous test (good).\n\n    \n\n\nThe test is now resilient, well done.

Dodds (and if you have not, do not worry, you are in the right place). Without anticipating too much, Testing Library is based on the assumption that the tests must consume the web app the same way the consumer does.\nWhat does it mean? Well, try thinking about how your users consume a web app: they look for contents, labels, placeholders, buttons, etc. to interact with them. They do not care about selectors, they care about contents. And if the users cannot find the elements through meaningful contents, they are not able to use the application and there are big UX problems. Testing from the user perspective allows you to find these problems early.\nTake a look at the test we wrote\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-3-data-testid.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    cy.visit(\"/register\");\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.get(\"[data-testid=username]\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.get(\"[data-testid=email]\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.get(\"[data-testid=password]\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n    cy.get(\"[data-testid=signup-button]\").click();\n    cy.get(\"[data-testid=no-articles-here]\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nAfter all, an input field with that responds to the [data-testid=username] selector do not give us the confidence that the user can consume it, nor that the right element has the data-testid attribute.\nThe Testing Library has a lot of plugins, one of them is dedicated to Cypress.\nAdding a plugin to Cypress is straightforward, in case of @testing-library/cypress, you must:\n\ninstall it with $ npm install --save-dev @testing-library/cypress\n\nadd import '@testing-library/cypress/add-commands' to the cypress/support/commands.js file\n\n\nNow we can leverage all the Testing Library functions, like findByText, findByPlaceholderText, etc. Thank it, we can make out test more robust, more readable, and more debuggable.\nWe need to change all the cy.get calls to the corresponding functions (added on the cy global object by Testing Library)\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Email\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Password\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.findByText(\"Sign up\").click();\n  cy.findByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\n    \"be.visible\"\n  );\n});\n\nTake a look at the test code, every command now is 100% aligned to what the user does while he/she tries to signup!\nLess debugging required\nThere is another, not to be ignored, advantage: what happens with the previous, data-testid-based, test when it fails?\nWe know what is the Test Runner feedback\n\n    \n\n\nbut this kind of feedback/error is generated by three different causes:\n\nthe input field does not exist\n\nthe input field exists but doesn't have data-testid attribute\n\nthe input field exists but its data-testid attribute is not set to username\n\n\nBoth latters cases don't have a visual correspondence (if you look at the web app, the input field exists!) and require you, in order to fix the issue, to open Cypress, run the test, inspect the DOM element, and check for its data-testid attribute. That's not an hour-long process but, again, if only the test could give us more useful feedback...\ncy.findByPlaceholderText, when it fails does exactly what we're talking about!\n\nyou just need to take a look at the Cypress screenshot (that it saves automatically) to check if\n\nthe input field does not exist\n\nthe input field has not the placeholder\n\nthe input field has not the right placeholder\n\n\nand we avoid a debugging process!\nMultiple elements\nIf we try to run the updated test\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.visit(\"/register\");\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(`Tester${random}`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Email\").type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Password\").type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.findByText(\"Sign up\").click();\n  cy.findByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\", { timeout: 10000 }).should(\n    \"be.visible\"\n  );\n});\n\nwe get an error\n\n\nmore in detail, the error is the following\n\n    \n\n\nThe error is pretty self-explanatory if you look at the UI, there are we different elements with the same text \"Sign Up\": the title and the button.\nThere are a lot of different solutions to leverage the findByText function distinguishing between the title and the button. The next solutions are just to get you to familiarize with the Cypress logics, the first three solutions are probably the best ones. We could:\n\nuse the within API to restrict the searching power of findByText\n\ncy.get(\"form\")\n  .within(() => cy.findByText(\"Sign up\"))\n  .click();\n\n\nleverage the selector option of findByText\n\ncy.findByText(\"Sign up\", { selector: \"button\" }).click();\n\n\nleverage the container option of findByText\n\ncy.get(\"form\")\n  .then(subject => cy.findByText(\"Sign up\", { container: subject }))\n  .click();\n\n\nselect the second element returned by the getAllByText API (insead of the findByText one)\n\ncy.getAllByText(\"Sign up\")\n  .then($el => $el[1])\n  .click();\n\n\nuse jQuery.grep (the jQuery version of array.find)\n\ncy.getAllByText(\"Sign up\")\n  .then($els =>\n    Cypress.$.grep($els, el => el.tagName.toLowerCase() === \"button\")\n  )\n  .click();\n\nPlease note: Cypress automatically exposes jQuery through Cypress.$.\n\nThere is an important difference between how cy.contains and cy.findByText work:\n\ncy.contains retrieves DOM elements even without an exact match (cy.contains(\"No articles are here\") works)\ncy.findByText does not retrieve DOM elements without an exact match (cy.findByText(\"No articles are here\") does not work, you need to replace it with cy.findByText(\"No articles are here... yet.\")...

We \"fixed\" the DOM-related ones by retrieving the elements based on the contents instead of the order, but there were a lot of problems related to the AJAX request itself. They were the following ones:\n\nthe AJAX call does not start\n\nthe AJAX call has the wrong request payload\n\nthe API does not work and it does not respond\n\nthe API returns the wrong payload\n\nthe user already exists\n\n\nThe test still does not help us with these errors. When it fails, we need to spend some time debugging what's happening in the web app (while it's under test) to discover that the issue was related to a wrong AJAX request... Do not despair, Cypress is here to improve the E2E testing experience!\nServer contract\nWhen we test the front-end of our web app, we need to consider it a closed block (blackbox testing) and we need to check how it interacts with the external world. We need to test the contracts between the front-end and all the involved entities. What are the contracts to be respected by the front-end app?\n\nfunctional contract with the user\n\npresentational contract with the user\n\ncontract with the server\n\n\nThe first one is the subject of the all the E2E tests, the second one is the subject for the visual regression tests, but we need to concentrate on the last one. A lot of times the front-end stops working because of a misaligned communication with the back-end.\nAJAX request waiting\nIf we know that an AJAX request happens systematically (it is going to happen every time) we need to consider it in our Cypress test. The signup flow is a good example. We are going to see what are the APIs that allow us to do that.\nFirst of all, we need to set up AJAX call interception:\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+ cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // the rest of the test code\n});\n\ncy.intercept tells Cypress to intercept some requests. We can use a lot of options to match precisely which AJAX request we want to intercept. cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\") tells Cypress to intercept every POST request to every URL that ends with **/api/users (the signup form makes a request to the http://localhost:3100/api/users, Cypress uses minimatch to take advantage of * and ** glob support).\nSecond: we need to set a Cypress alias to reference it later on\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n+   .as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // the rest of the test code\n});\n\nThird: we must \"wait\" the AJAX request triggered by the front-end app\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n    .as(\"signup-request\");\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  // form filling code\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n+ cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n  cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWhat does \"waiting\" main for an AJAX request? Here we can see the advantages of automatic Cypress waitings mixed with AJAX requests management! By asking Cypress to cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");, it's going to wait up to 5 seconds for the front-end to start the request and up to 30 seconds for the back-end to fulfill the request (both of the timeouts are customizable).\nLast change: do you remember why did we add the custom timeout to the cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }) call? We added it while speaking about the stability of the test because we faced the problem that cy.contain (later replaced by cy.findByText) sometimes failed because the AJAX request took too long (and the default cy.contain/cy.findByText timeout is 4000 milliseconds). Now we do not need it anymore because the cy.wait knows that an AJAX request could take a really long time!\n- cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n+ cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\nThat's all the changes we applied to the test\nit(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n+ cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\")\n+   .as(\"signup-request\");\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(`Tester${random}`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n+ cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n- cy.findByText(noArticles, { timeout: 10000 }).should(\"be.visible\");\n+ cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nand that's the test with some comments\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-6-ajax-request-waiting.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(`Tester${random}`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(`user+${random}@realworld.io`);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(\"mysupersecretpassword\");\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe test is now way more robust because\n\nwe do not wait only for something that \"reflects\" the result of the AJAX request (the \"No articles are here\" string) but for the AJAX request itself\n\nwe do not wait up to a \"random\" (the previous {timeout: 10000}) amount of time but up to a longer time. 10 seconds could not be enough (if you have ever consumed some AWS Lambdas you know what I'm talking about) because of the back-end wakeup/caching times\n\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/payload-assertions.html":{"url":"book/payload-assertions.html","title":"Asserting on payloads","keywords":"","body":"Asserting on payloads\nHere we are again: before summing up all the improvements we made to the original test, we need to speak about AJAX payloads assertions.

What I mean: I try to analyze the yielded subject for every line of code\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\") // yields the whole `interception` object\n  .its(\"request.body\") // yields `interception.request.body`\n  .should(\"have.property\", \"user\") // yields `interception.request.body.user`\n  .and(\"be.a\", \"object\") // (still) yields `interception.request.body.user`\n  .should(\"have.property\", \"username\", user.username) // yields `interception.request.body.user.username`\n  // ... how we can assert about `interception.request.body.user.email`?\n  .and(\"have.property\", \"email\", user.email); // will fail because `interception.request.body.user.username` does not have an `email` property\n\nAsserting directly on cy.wait(\"@signup-request\") will not work, that's why we need to take advantage of another assertion syntax, the following one\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n  expect(interception.request.body)\n    .to.have.property(\"user\")\n    .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\n  expect(interception.request.body.user).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username);\n  expect(interception.request.body.user).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\n});\n\nthis way you always have a reference the original interception object and its data. Since we have a list of all the things we need to assert about, writing all the assertions is easy:\n\nrequest payload assertions\n\nexpect(interception.request.body)\n  .to.have.property(\"user\")\n  .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\nlet payload = interception.request.body.user;\nexpect(payload).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username);\nexpect(payload).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\nexpect(payload).to.have.property(\"password\", user.password);\n\n\nresponse payload assertions\n\nexpect(interception.response.body)\n  .to.have.property(\"user\")\n  .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\npayload = interception.response.body.user;\nexpect(payload).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username.toLowerCase());\nexpect(payload).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\nexpect(payload)\n  .to.have.property(\"token\")\n  .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n\n\nresponse status assertion (it's important too)\n\nexpect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\nThe whole file is the following\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-7-ajax-payload-assertion.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    const user = {\n      username: `Tester${random}`,\n      email: `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n      let payload;\n\n      // request check\n      expect(interception.request.body)\n        .to.have.property(\"user\")\n        .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\n      payload = interception.request.body.user;\n      expect(payload).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username);\n      expect(payload).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\n      expect(payload).to.have.property(\"password\", user.password);\n\n      // status check\n      expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n      // response check\n      expect(interception.response.body)\n        .to.have.property(\"user\")\n        .and.to.be.a(\"object\");\n      payload = interception.response.body.user;\n      expect(payload).to.have.property(\"username\", user.username.toLowerCase());\n      expect(payload).to.have.property(\"email\", user.email);\n      expect(payload)\n        .to.have.property(\"token\")\n        .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n    });\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nYou can read more about the Cypress assertions in the official documentation.\nIn the next screenshot you can find (one of) the result of so much assertions: a punctual feedback in case of an error with the AJAX request\n\n    \n\n\nSmarter assertions\nThe assertions show above are precise but not so smart. Their feedback is not smart neither, take a look at the next screenshot\n\n    \n\n\nWe can maintain all the usefulness of the feedback while making them a little smarter leveraging one of the combinations offered by Cypress to write assertions. The next code asserts the same things in a more concise mode and with more concise feedback too\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n  expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n    user: {\n      username: user.username,\n      email: user.email,\n      password: user.password\n    }\n  });\n\n  expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n  cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n    .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n    .and(\n      user =>\n        expect(user)\n          .to.have.property(\"token\")\n          .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n    )\n    .and(\"deep.include\", {\n      username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n      email: user.email\n    });\n});\n\n\n    \n\n\nYou can find the whole test code in the signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js file.\nChai plugins\nFor the sake of curiosity, we can condense the previous assertions again. For example, with the chai-subset plugin (Chai is a famous assertion library included by Cypress) we can write a giant assertion that checks everything: the status and the payloads\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n  expect(interception).to.containSubset({\n    request: {\n      body: {\n        user: {\n          username: user.username,\n          email: user.email,\n          password: user.password\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    response: {\n      statusCode: 200,\n      body: {\n        user: {\n          username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n          email: user.email\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n});\n\nbut it's not recommended because, in case of failure, the feedback is too much generic:\n\n    \n\n\nIf you'd like to know how you can install a Chai plugin and use it in Cypress:\n\nopen the cypress/support/index.js file\n\nimport the plugin with import chaiSubset from \"chai-subset\";\n\nadd it to Chai with chai.use(chaiSubset);\n\n\nThe test code is in the signup-9-chai-plugin.e2e.spec.js file.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/signup-custom-command.html":{"url":"book/signup-custom-command.html","title":"Signup","keywords":"","body":"Custom commands\nAt least half of the RealWorld features require the user to be authenticated. By default, Cypress forces you to not share the state between the tests and it makes sense because it's a huge anti-pattern. We need to transform the signup process into something usable by every test: a Cypress custom command.\nA Cypress Custom Command is a function that can be called from the global cy object. We are going to create a cy.signupV1() command to be run before every other test.\nThe steps needed to create a new Cypress custom command are the next:\n\ncreate a new file containing the code of the command itself into the cypress/support directory. The file is the cypress/support/signup/signup-v1.js\n\nadd the wrapper of the code\n\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV1\", (/* the params of the command */) => {\n  /* the code of the command */\n});\n\n\nimport the newly created file from the cypress/support/commands.js file\n\nimport \"./signup/signup-v1\";\n\n\nstart writing a new test that calls the cy.signupV1() command\n\ncontext(\"Whatever test\", () => {\n  it(\"Should leverage the custom registration command\", () => {\n    cy.signupV1();\n  });\n});\n\n\nrun the test!\n\nObviously, the new command does nothing at the moment, but this is the foundation of cy.signupV1 command.\nFirst signup command\nThe first implementation is simple and not very smart, the core of the command is the same of the\nsignup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js test.\nWhile creating reusable commands, the testing rules remain the same. The most important ones for our exercise are:\n\nthe commands must be as simple as possible\n\nthe commands must be flexible and easily customizable\n\n\nThe former is respected because we are going to copy all the code from the just written signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js test. The latter leads us to ask a question: what could be changed with a global and reusable signup utility? Essentially, only the user data.\nThe command must accept the user data with the usual defaults if not provided\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV1\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // The rest of the code...\n});\n\nThe rest of the code is 100% the same of the signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js test, the only change is placed at the end: a closing cy.then(() => user); so the data used to register the user can be consumed by chaining a command to the cy.signupV1() call.\nThe whole code is the following:\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v1.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV1\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  // form filling\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n  cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n\n  // form submit...\n  cy.get(\"form\")\n    .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click())\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n    expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\nand the test that leverages the custom command is:\ncontext(\"Whatever test\", () => {\n  it(\"Should leverage the custom registration command\", () => {\n    cy.signupV1();\n    cy.log(\"The user is now registered and authanticated\");\n    cy.findByText(\"New Post\").should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nPlease note that the new command is not a replacement for the signup tests.

Let's introduce the concept of App Actions. The same way we leveraged and talked about App Constants, App Actions are utilities exposed directly from the front-end application. Let's work on a signup App Action.\nIn the RealWorld app front-end app, the registration is managed by the Register.js component. In its constructor, you can find the following code\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n};\n\nthis.submitForm is the handler that we should trigger automatically from our custom command. We could do that exposing it globally\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n}\n+window.appActions = window.appActions || {};\n+window.appActions.signup = ({username, email, password}) => this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n\nbut since polluting the global scope is not ideal and since we need it only when the application is under test, we could check the existence of the window.Cypress object before exposing it\nthis.submitForm = (username, email, password) => ev => {\n  ev.preventDefault();\n  this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n}\n\n+if(window.Cypress) {\n  window.appActions = window.appActions || {};\n  window.appActions.signup = ({username, email, password}) => this.props.onSubmit(username, email, password);\n+}\n\nIf you think that adding fictitious code to the application is not a good idea, remember that:\n\na lot of times the source code is soiled with temporary code/conditions that allow you to manually test some particular conditions (network errors or the authenticated user)\n\nyou can easily remove the code leveraging Webpack replacing every window.Cypress occurrence with false and then removing the unused code the same way\n\ntest duration is more important because you are going to run the tests thousands of times\n\n\nWhat's the final goal of the window.appActions.signup app action? Simply, calling it from the Cypress test! We can now call it directly deleting the slow form filling. Starting from the code of the signup-v1.js test, the changes are the following\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n-cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n-cy.get(\"form\")\n- .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click())\n+cy.window()\n+ .its(\"appActions\")\n+ .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\nYou can find the whole code of the custom command into the signup-v2.js custom command\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v2.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n    expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\nThe signupV2 custom command is used by the signup-command-2.e2e.spec.js test and the performance improvement is notable compared to the previous signup-command-1.e2e.spec.js one\n\n    \n\n\nAs you can see, there are no interactions with the form itself\n\n\nthat's how App Actions work, they're just test-related shortcuts to perform fast and safe operations.\nFast because:\n\nreaching the desired front-end state through the UI is a big and slow anti-pattern. If you take a look at the signup-command-1.e2e.spec.js test, form filling (performed by the signup-v1.js custom command) takes circa 1.5 seconds each time. We can not waste so much time for every test, what could happen when the test suite will count tens or hundreds of tests?\n\nSafe because:\n\nwe can unleash our imagination when we speak about testing performance improvements. We could apply every kind of esoteric solution but the truth is that a lot of them make the test harder to comprehend, to modify and less aligned with the front-end logic. App actions are clear and concise\n\nthere are no differences between the front-end code and test code, so there are not two different codes to be maintained\n\n\nApp Actions sometimes can not be used but the more we leverage them, the more robust and fast the tests are.\nPageObject\nJust for your information: PageObject is the common pattern used widely before the concept of App Actions borned. The problem with the PageObject pattern is that you create one more abstraction to manage that could lose its effectiveness in a while causing more problems than advantages. If you want to deepen the comparison between the two approaches you could read the Stop using Page Objects and Start using App Actions post.\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/sharing-authentication-state.html":{"url":"book/sharing-authentication-state.html","title":"Sharing authentication state","keywords":"","body":"Sharing authentication state\nWe know that the state must not be shared between subsequent tests because it's the reason #1 for brittle tests. But when you know the rules, you know the motivations behind them and how to bend them to your needs.\nCiting again the testing rules: why should we not share the state between tests? Imagine this scenario:\n\ntest a registers a new user and does actions that need the user to be registered\n\ntest b does actions that need the user to be registered\n\n\nYou are going to break the test b test if\n\nyou run it alone with it.only()\n\nyou skip the test a with it.skip()\n\nyou change the order\n\nyou move the test b to another file or vice-versa\n\n\nsumming up: every test must be independent.\nIn the previous chapter, we improved the test performance but it's still quite slow. Every test registers a new user and it would be cool if all the tests could share the same, already registered, user... But if we only have to maintain test independence, we could write a custom command that registers a new user, store the user token and restore the token before the next step!\nOne thing at a time:\n\nthe RealWorld front-end stores the user token with a jwt local storage field\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nwe could copy it after the first registration (it can be accessed in Cypress with localStorage.jwt)\n\nthen, we can restore it for every future test (checking that the user is still valid and authenticated for the back-end)\n\n\nLet's write the cy.signupV3 custom command, starting from the cy.signupV2 command that's the following:\nFile: cypress/support/signup/signup-v2.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n  const user = {\n    username: username || `Tester${random}`,\n    email: email || `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n    password: password || \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  // set up AJAX call interception\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  // ... and AJAX call waiting\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n    expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n      user: {\n        username: user.username,\n        email: user.email,\n        password: user.password\n      }\n    });\n\n    expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n    cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n      .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n      .and(\n        user =>\n          expect(user)\n            .to.have.property(\"token\")\n            .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n      )\n      .and(\"deep.include\", {\n        username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n        email: user.email\n      });\n  });\n\n  // end of the flow\n  cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n\n  cy.then(() => user);\n});\n\ncy.gignupV3\nStoring the token\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\n+let previousUserData = {};\nCypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n  // ... the command code...\n\n  cy\n+ // wait until the localStorage token is saved\n+   .wrap(localStorage)\n+   .its(\"jwt\")\n+   .should(jwt => expect(jwt).to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty)\n+   .then(jwt => {\n+     previousUserData = {\n+       jwt,\n+       username,\n+       email,\n+       password,\n+       user\n+     };\n+   })\n    .then(() => user);\n});\n\nWhat the new code does:\n\nwaits until the localStorage.jwt token is available, the front-end does not set it synchronously (or, better, you should get accustomed that nothing is synchronous with E2E tests). This waiting is made easy by the inner Cypress retry-ability that retries the previous command (unless it could potentially change the state of the application under test like a click could do) until the assertions pass.\n\nSo, the jwt retrieval (.its(\"jwt\")) is retried until the next assertion .should(jwt => expect(jwt).to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty) passes.\n\nonce the jwt token is set, it stores all the user data (the token, the parameters, and the new user object)\n\n\"returns\" the user object with .then(() => user). It's an asynchronous flow so it \"returns\" the object by chaining it\n\n\nInitial token check\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\n\nlet previousUserData = {};\n-Cypress.Commands.add(\"signupV2\", ({ email, username, password } = {}) => {\n+Cypress.Commands.add(\"signupV3\", ({ email, username, password, ignoreLocalStorage = false } = {}) => {\n+   let user;\n    // if the user data match the previous one\n+   if (!ignoreLocalStorage && previousUserData.jwt && previousUserData.email === email) {\n+     cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check ⚠️\");\n\n      // set the stored token\n+     localStorage.setItem(\"jwt\", previousUserData.jwt);\n\n+     cy.visit(\"/\")\n      // use the \"New Post\" string to detect if the user is authenticated or not\n+     cy.findByText(newPost)\n+       .then($el => $el.length !== 0)\n+       .then(userIsAuthenticated => {\n+         if (userIsAuthenticated) {\n+           cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check passed ✅\");\n+           user = previousUserData.user;\n+         } else {\n+           // removed the stored token\n+           localStorage.removeItem(\"jwt\");\n+         }\n+       });\n+   }\n\n+   cy.then(() => {\n+     if (user) {\n+       return user;\n+     }\n+     cy.log(\"signupV3: Authentication check failed ❌ a new user is going to be registered\");\n\n\n    // ... the rest of the command code...\n});\n\nStep by step:\n\nfirst of all, we need to check that the user and the \"previous\" user are the same. We could do so checking the cy.signup() parameters to understand what email the test wants to have registered.

Both of them are really important for a good testing experience, one that does not make you hate the test suite.\nWith the new cy.signupV3 custom command we are sure that:\n\nthe first user is registered as usual\n\nif it's possible, the test takes advantage of the previously registered user, saving precious seconds\n\nif something goes wrong and the back-end does not recognize the previous user, a new one is registered\n\n\nIn the end: every test that leverages the cy.signupV3 command gets a registered user, the fastest possible way.\nPlease note: the performance improvements vary for every application, we artificially slowed down the RealWorld for the sake of this course.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/stubbing-the-backend.html":{"url":"book/stubbing-the-backend.html","title":"Stubbing the Back-end","keywords":"","body":"Stubbing the back-end\nWhat's the matter with E2E tests? Well, they:\n\nare slow: in the previous chapter we dedicated a lot of attention to reduce the test duration but we three/four/five seconds are still too much. It's not a good result because we run just a few tests but a front-end application requires a lot more tests\n\ndo not allow the front-ender to work without a back-ender: this is a huge limit. We all know that we can not count on all the infrastructure 24/7, nor on our devops/back-end colleagues. Often, the front-end development and the back-end one do not proceed side by side either\n\nthey make edge cases replication hard: if we work with real data, we are going to spend most of the time dealing with it with a 20-40% of the time remaining for the front-end tests themselves\n\n\nSo: E2E tests are not feasible for front-end testing. They are important, obviously, but we cannot rely on them too much. That's the reason why E2E testing is at the top of the testing pyramid, they give you the most amount of confidence but they are super expensive in terms of writing, maintenance, and stability.\nGoing down with the testing pyramid we can find the integration tests, a kind of tests where a part of the application is tested, a middle ground between E2E testing (whole front-end+back-end app) and unit testing (single unit/module test). Cypress allows us to write \"one more\" type of test easily: UI Integration Tests. The goal is to test the whole front-end app but without a real back-end. All the AJAX requests are stubbed with static responses. The main advantages are:\n\nextreme speed: Cypress respond to the front-end AJAX requests in hundredths of a second\n\nfront-end testing independence: we test the front-end while developing the front-end, we are no more tied to the back-end so we do not need to delay the front-end testing anymore\n\ntesting confidence: testing the whole front-end in a browser gives you more and more confidence than a JSDom test with the terminal\n\nedge cases replication: with static responses, you can simulate (or reproduce, if you're analyzing a bug) every edge case in a while\n\n\nPleas note an important terminology difference:\n\na stub is a static response used to \"replace\" the server one\n\na mock is a simplified, yet working, version of the back-end. It has the same APIs (from a front-end perspective) but with the minimun complexity neede to simulate the real back-end functionalities\n\n\nImplementing the first UI Integration test\nUntil now, we have tested the registration flow and we have written a custom command to allow every test to consume the front-end with an authenticated user. We are going to analyze the signup flow firstly.\nThe state of the art of our E2E signup flow is the following:\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/signup/signup-8-simpler-assertions.e2e.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\n    const user = {\n      username: `Tester${random}`,\n      email: `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username).type(user.username);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email).type(user.email);\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password).type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\").should(interception => {\n      expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n        user: {\n          username: user.username,\n          email: user.email,\n          password: user.password\n        }\n      });\n\n      expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n      cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n        .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n        .and(\n          user =>\n            expect(user)\n              .to.have.property(\"token\")\n              .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n        )\n        .and(\"deep.include\", {\n          username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n          email: user.email\n        });\n    });\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nnow, we need to transform it into a UI Integration test, the steps are:\n\nwe do not need a random user anymore. We randomized the user data to improve the test determinism and to avoid to register the same user twice\n\n-const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000);\nconst user = {\n- username: `Tester${random}`,\n+ username: \"Tester\",\n- email: `user+${random}@realworld.io`,\n+ email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n  password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n};\n\n\nwe need to instrument Cypress to intercept every AJAX request and respond with a static response. We use another feature of the cy.intercept command, introduced with the Waiting for an AJAX request chapter: passing a response\n\n-cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\").as(\"signup-request\");\n+cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n+ headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" },\n+ body: {\n+   user: {\n+     username: \"Tester\",\n+     email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n+     token:\n+       \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZhZjc4YTkzNGFiMDRhZjRhMzE0MCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNzk1MzYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzM4MzY2ODAsImlhdCI6MTU2ODY0OTA4MH0.zcHxMz2Vx5h-EoiUZlRyUw0z_A_6AIZ0LzQgROvsPqw\"\n+   }\n+ }\n+}).as(\"signup-request\");\n\nwhere does the {user: {...}} response come from? From inspecting the response of the back-end to the POST JAJAX call to the /api/users API\n\nplease note that we must care about CORS too, without setting the headers with headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" } the browser will block thr request because localhost:4100 can't perform XHR requests to localhost:3100 without proper CORS management.\n\nwe need to stub (the process of intercepting and responding with static data) even more AJAX calls because, once the signup flow is complete, the home page calls some more APIs to populate the page.\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe test Runner helps us a lot identifying the unstubbed AJAX calls\n\n    \n\n\nas you can see:\n\nthe first AJAX call is a POST to /api/users, it's stubbed and the alias is signup-request\nthe second AJAX call is a GET to /api/tags and it's unstubbed (it hits the back-end application)\nthe third AJAX call is a GET to /api/articles/feed and it's unstubbed\n\nThe Test Runner is a precious ally while trying to understand why the front-end behaves an unexpected way...\nWe can stub both the second and the third AJAX calls with\ncy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { body: { tags: [] }, headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }, }).as(\"tags\");\ncy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", {\n  body: {\n    articles: [],\n    articlesCount: 0\n  },\n  headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n}).as(\"feed\");\n\n\nwe do not need to check the AJAX response payload anymore (since it's Cypress that responds in place of the back-end app)\n\n-expect(interception.response.statusCode).to.equal(200);\n\n-cy.wrap(interception.response.body)\n- .should(\"have.property\", \"user\")\n- .and(\n-   user =>\n-     expect(user)\n-       .to.have.property(\"token\")\n-       .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n- )\n- .and(\"deep.include\", {\n-   username: user.username.toLowerCase(),\n-   email: user.email\n- });\n\n\nwe should wait for the two AJAX calls\n\ncy.wait(\"@signup-request\")\n.should(interception =>\n  expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n    user: {\n      username: user.username,\n      email: user.email,\n      password: user.password\n    }\n  })\n)\n+.wait([\"@tags\", \"@feed\"]);\n\nAnd we're done! You can take a look at the whole test and run it, it's the\ncypress/integration/examples/signup-integration/signup-1.integration.spec.js file\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\nconst headers = { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const user = {\n      username: \"Tester\",\n      email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n      body: {\n        user: {\n          username: \"Tester\",\n          email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n          token:\n            \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVkN2ZhZjc4YTkzNGFiMDRhZjRhMzE0MCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdGVyNzk1MzYiLCJleHAiOjE1NzM4MzY2ODAsImlhdCI6MTU2ODY0OTA4MH0.zcHxMz2Vx5h-EoiUZlRyUw0z_A_6AIZ0LzQgROvsPqw\"\n        }\n      },\n      headers\n    }).as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { body: { tags: []}, headers }).as(\"tags\");\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", { body: { articles: [], articlesCount: 0 }, headers }).as(\"feed\");\n\n\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username)\n      .type(user.username)\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email)\n      .type(user.email)\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password)\n      .type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click())\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\")\n      .should(interception =>\n        expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n          user: {\n            username: user.username,\n            email: user.email,\n            password: user.password\n          }\n        })\n      )\n      .wait([\"@tags\", \"@feed\"]);\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nThe most astonishing result is the speed of the test &#x1F631;\n\n    \n\n\nWhy should we test the request payload in the UI Integration Tests too? Leveraging the fact that the requests do not hit the back-end, we are going to use this kind of tests for a lot of different paths. Some of these paths will not have a corresponding E2E test because they would be too much expensive. Since request payloads are super important, we can not think to check only the ones included in an E2E test.\nA good case to think about is a searchable list, we are going to have probably ten/twenty UI Integration tests (with different request payloads) for it but just two or three E2E tests.\nAuthor: Stefano

All we need to do is:\n\nreading the fixture\n\nreading the contained token\n\nsetting the jwt token\n\n\nThe command code is the following\nFile: cypress/support/authentication/authenticate-integration.js\n/// \n\nCypress.Commands.add(\"authenticateIntegration\", () => {\n  cy.fixture(\"users/signup\")\n    .its(\"user\")\n    .should(\n      user =>\n        expect(user)\n          .to.have.property(\"token\")\n          .and.to.be.a(\"string\").and.not.to.be.empty\n    )\n    .then(user => localStorage.setItem(\"jwt\", user.token));\n});\n\nPlease note that there are some assertions about the fixture content itself, the goal is always the same: getting the more out of the assertion feedback. If we change the fixture content accidentally the command is going to prompts us with a useful message.\nThe test that navigates the home page leveraging an already \"authenticated\" is the following\ncontext(\"The custom command could be run before the test code\", () => {\n  it(\"Should leverage the custom authentication command\", () => {\n    cy.authenticateIntegration().should(user => {\n      expect(user).to.have.property(\"username\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n      expect(user).to.have.property(\"email\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n    });\n\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { fixture: \"tags/empty-tags\" }).as(\"get-tags\");\n    cy.intercept(\n      \"GET\",\n      \"**/api/articles/feed**\",\n      { fixture: \"articles/empty-articles\" }\n    ).as(\"get-feed\");\n\n    cy.visit(\"/\");\n\n    cy.wait([\"@get-tags\", \"@get-feed\"]);\n\n    cy.findByText(newPost).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nBut, when running it, we get an error from Cypress\n\n    \n\n\nthe Test Runner speaks for itself: the RealWorld front-end fires a GET api/user expecting the same data returned by the signup AJAX request (POST api/users), nothing that we cannot stub and wait in a while\n+cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/user\", { fixture: \"users/signup\" }).as(\"get-user\");\ncy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { fixture: \"tags/empty-tags\" }).as(\"get-tags\");\ncy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", { fixture: \"articles/empty-articles\" }).as(\"get-feed\");\n\n-cy.wait([\"@get-tags\", \"@get-feed\"]);\n+cy.wait([\"@get-user\", \"@get-tags\", \"@get-feed\"]);\n\nHere the full code of the test\nFile: cypress/integration/examples/authenticate-command/authenticate-command-1.integration.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { newPost } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Header\";\n\nconst headers = { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n\ncontext(\"The custom command could be run before the test code\", () => {\n  it(\"Should leverage the custom authentication command\", () => {\n    cy.authenticateIntegration().should((user) => {\n      expect(user).to.have.property(\"username\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n      expect(user).to.have.property(\"email\").and.not.to.be.empty;\n    });\n\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"/api/user\", { fixture: \"users/signup.json\", headers }).as(\"get-user\");\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { fixture: \"tags/empty-tags.json\", headers }).as(\"get-tags\");\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", {fixture: \"articles/empty-articles\", headers }).as(\"get-feed\");\n\n    cy.visit(\"/\");\n\n    cy.wait([\"@get-user\", \"@get-tags\", \"@get-feed\"]);\n\n    cy.findByText(newPost).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nAn all-in-one command\nSince the front-end does a call to the GET api/user API as its very first thing, we could write a more complete command that cares about the request itself.

That's really important because E2E tests are often considered the only solution to the front-end testing problem, but with so much disadvantages that they discouraged a lot of developers.\nAnyway, two of the three main E2E testing problems were front-end developer independence and edge case replication. We can face both of them are easy with UI Integration Testing and back-end stubs. As an example, we could test the error paths that could happen with the registration flow. At the moment, the state of the art of our integration signup flow is the following:\nFile: cypress/integration/examplessignup-integration/signup-2.integration.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\nimport { noArticles } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/ArticleList\";\nimport { strings } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/Register\";\n\nconst headers = { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"The happy path should work\", () => {\n    const user = {\n      username: \"Tester\",\n      email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n\n    // set up AJAX call interception\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", { fixture: \"users/signup\", headers }).as(\"signup-request\");\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/tags\", { fixture: \"tags/empty-tags\", headers }).as(\"tags\");\n    cy.intercept(\"GET\", \"**/api/articles/feed**\", { fixture: \"articles/empty-articles\", headers }).as(\"feed\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    // form filling\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.username)\n      .type(user.username)\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.email)\n      .type(user.email)\n    cy.findByPlaceholderText(strings.password)\n      .type(user.password);\n\n    // form submit...\n    cy.get(\"form\")\n      .within(() => cy.findByText(strings.signUp).click());\n\n    // ... and AJAX call waiting\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\")\n      .should(interception =>\n        expect(interception.request.body).deep.equal({\n          user: {\n            username: user.username,\n            email: user.email,\n            password: user.password\n          }\n        })\n      )\n      .wait([\"@tags\", \"@feed\"]);\n\n    // end of the flow\n    cy.findByText(noArticles).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n});\n\nbut there are a lot of error paths that are not been covered yet. The RealWorld front-end does not manage \"all\" possible paths, but then if the back-end app responds with an error \"email/user already registered\", it prints the error as they are.\n\n\nSpying the back-end response, it turns out that its something like { errors: { email: \"is already taken.\" } } and the response status is 422. We need to reproduce it with the cy.intercept, its options contemplate the statusCode option too. All we need to do is passing all exploded options to the cy.intercept command\ncy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n  body: { errors: { email: \"is already taken.\" } },\n  statusCode: 422,\n  headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n}).as(\"signup-request\");\n\nthe url, method, and body are not new, the statusCode option is. With a response like this, the error reported by the front-end is \"email is already taken.\". The test is not so many different from the old one (the happy path flow), that's the full code\nit(\"Should show an error if the back-end report that the email has already been used\", () => {\n  const user = {\n    username: \"Tester\",\n    email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n    password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n    body: { errors: { email: \"is already taken.\" } },\n    statusCode: 422,\n    headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n  }).as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n  cy.findByText(\"email is already taken.\").should(\"be.visible\");\n});\n\nWe could make it even more generic testing the case of multiple errors coming from the back-end\n-it(\"Should show an error if the back-end report that the email has already been used\", () => {\n+it(\"Should show some errors if the back-end reports that some data has already been used\", () => {\n+ const body = { errors: { username: \"is already taken.\", email: \"is already taken.\" } };\n  const user = {\n    username: \"Tester\",\n    email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n    password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n  };\n\n  cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n-   body: { errors: { email: \"is already taken.\" } }\n+   body\n    statusCode: 422,\n    headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n  }).as(\"signup-request\");\n\n  cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n  cy.window()\n    .its(\"appActions\")\n    .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n  cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n- cy.findByText(\"email is already taken.\").should(\"be.visible\");\n+ Object.entries(body.errors).map(([subject, error]) => {\n+   cy.findByText(`${subject} ${error}`).should(\"be.visible\");\n+ });\n});\n\nBelow there are both the single-error test and the multiple-errors one\nFile: cypress/integration/examplessignup-integration/signup-error-paths-1.integration.spec.js\n/// \n\nimport { paths } from \"../../../../realworld/frontend/src/components/App\";\n\ncontext(\"Signup flow\", () => {\n  it(\"Should show an error if the back-end report that the email has already been used\", () => {\n    const body = { errors: { email: \"is already taken.\" } };\n    const user = {\n      username: \"Tester\",\n      email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n      body,\n      statusCode: 422,\n      headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" },\n    }).as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    cy.window()\n      .its(\"appActions\")\n      .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n    cy.findByText(`email ${body.errors.email}`).should(\"be.visible\");\n  });\n\n  it(\"Should show some errors if the back-end reports that some data has already been used\", () => {\n    const body = { errors: { username: \"is already taken.\", email: \"is already taken.\" } };\n    const user = {\n      username: \"Tester\",\n      email: \"user@realworld.io\",\n      password: \"mysupersecretpassword\"\n    };\n\n    cy.intercept(\"POST\", \"**/api/users\", {\n      body,\n      statusCode: 422,\n      headers: { \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\" }\n    }).as(\"signup-request\");\n\n    cy.visit(paths.register);\n\n    cy.window()\n      .its(\"appActions\")\n      .invoke(\"signup\", user);\n\n    cy.wait(\"@signup-request\");\n\n    Object.entries(body.errors).map(([subject, error]) => {\n      cy.findByText(`${subject} ${error}`).should(\"be.visible\");\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nAlmost all the code of the tests is the same.

So, write a few E2E tests (just for the happy paths) and concentrate on the UI Integration Tests.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/cypress-as-a-development-tool.html":{"url":"book/cypress-as-a-development-tool.html","title":"Cypress as a development tool","keywords":"","body":"Cypress as a development tool\nUntil now, we have tested an existing front-end application but usually, we are used to writing the tests after the implementation.\nWhile we code the flow, we want to avoid fighting with a testing tool that goes red every now and then. That's why we manually test what we do but, most of the times, we spend a considerable amount of time showing components with temporary props, hard-coding temporary snippet that sends us directly to the desired state of the app, etc. Last but not least, we interact with the half-built flow manually. When we finish, we remove all the temporary code and we start writing all the tests.\nThis process has a lot of limitations:\n\nmanually interacting with the app is slow, really slow\n\nadding temporary code to the codebase is potentially dangerous\n\nthe tests that we are going to write... Do the same things we have done manually! (interacting with the app)\n\n\nInstead, think for a while about our recent experience with Cypress:\n\nCypress is blazing fast while interacting with the page\n\nthe UI tests do not require special temporary code\n\nCypress allows us to act as the back-end, simulating real network conditions from a browser perspective\n\n\nWhat is blocking us from using Cypress during the development phase and not only during the test phase? After all, Cypress\n\n✅ is always opened\n\n✅ relaunch the tests as soon as we save the test file\n\n✅ relaunch the test every time the application refreshes because of the Webpack DevServer (and if you have a different transpiling process you could leverage the cypress-watch-and-reload plugin)\n\n✅ allows you to use the Chrome DevTools (the Electron ones)\n\n\neven if...\n\n⚠️ the real Chrome DevTools are more powerful than the Electron ones\n\n❌ we can not install the React/Redux DevTools into Electron\n\n⚠️ going back and forth from the test code to skip/select a test to run could be tedious\n\n\nThe solution\nDo you know that Cypress could be launched in every Chrome version? Do you know that Cypress creates a dedicated (and persisted) Chrome user?\nTake a look at the upper right corner of the Cypress list of tests\n\n    \n\n\nCypress allows us to choose the Chrome instances that it finds on our machine. I prefer to use Chrome Canary instead of the standard Chrome just to have a different (yellow) icon and recognize immediately the testing-dedicated browser.\n\n    \n\n\nand, with a real Google Chrome instance, we can install the React and Redux DevTools as usual (from the Chrome extension website).\n\n    \n\n\nMore: the Crome user of Cypress is persisted through all the projects! So, once we installed our extensions of choice, we can use them in every project!\nThe only thing we have to do to get the React DevTools working is adding the following snippet to the public/index.html of your create-react-app project\n\n  if (window.Cypress) {\n    window[\"__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__\"] =\n      window.parent[\"__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__\"];\n  }\n\n\nthe snippet is needed because the React app runs inside an iframe when launched under Cypress.\nAbout the Chrome DevTools console: to access the global scope of your app you need to change the JavaScript context in the upper-left corner of the console itself. See the next screenshot where window.appActions (defined during the App Actions chapter) becomes available only after a context selection.\n\nTo avoid going back and forth from the code test to exclude/select the tests: we could add the cypress-skip-and-only-ui plugin that adds some buttons to the Test Runner. These buttons allow us to run only a test, to skip some tests or to restore the standard order of the tests. It does, through some simple buttons, what we usually do manually adding .only or .skip to the tests.\n\n    \n\n\nWith all the above tips you discover a new way of working... And you discover that cy.findByPlaceholderText(\"Username\").type(\"Foo\") is way faster than your manually typing. And when you finish... You have already written the tests!\nPlease note: this is not TDD! We have just talked about how to leverage a testing tool to improve our productivity but the aim is not to start TDDing. You should forget about TDD until you are a practiced testing-developer and you work in a team/company that creates the right environment for an approach like that.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/dedicated-scripts.html":{"url":"book/dedicated-scripts.html","title":"Dedicated scripts","keywords":"","body":"Dedicated scripts\nIf you respect a naming convention like the one proposed earlier that was something like cypress/integration//..spec.js (where TYPEOFTEST is integration, e2e, etc.) is easy to create dedicated scripts for each kind of tests.\nIt could be helpful even for other members of the team: imagine a back-ender that is going to release an update and want to run just the E2E tests locally to be sure that everything works as expected, a npm run tests:e2e script could be helpful for him.

That's not an easy task, there are tons of NPM modules that do it for us but...\n\nbut they're slow, taking and comparing 50/100 screenshots could take minutes\n\nthe confidence they give is relative, a lot of times they give false negatives. You usually set a \"tolerance\" ratio that does not care if, for example, \"less than 2% of the pixels are different\". Why do you need to set it? Well, take a look at the next image\n\n\n\nthe image in the center highlights the difference, in terms of changed pixels, between the two images... Just for a browser update...\n\nthe same way we write a lot of different tests, we need to visually test a lot of different tools/pages/views (think about the whole app and every Storybook story for example)\n\nwe need to test a lot of different browsers: if a lot of times the functional (JavaScript) features do not need to be tested on different browsers, we cannot say the same for the visual (CSS) aspect. Different browser render different things, this gets the visual testing harder\n\n\nIt all depends on your needs, there are a lot of manual-triggered solutions (like the StoryShots addon for Storybook or the image-snapshot plugin for Cypress) but the suggestion is to leverage professional services like Percy and Applitools. You need to face the limits of non-professional tools so early that it's hard to tell if they worth a try.\nProfessional and dedicated tools are not free but they simplify your life, they:\n\ncan be integrated into your existing stack\n\nprovide you a nice UI to perform visual testing\n\nprovide cross-browser support\n\nmanage automatically and smartly the little differences to avoid false negatives\n\nmove the workload on their servers instead of your local machine\n\n\nIf you want see how a professional tool could help you with Visual Regression Testing, see the Writing Tests For CSS Is Possible!

Mix it with analyzable request/response payloads and you get total control over front-end/back-end communications\n\nautomatic waitings and retry-ability avoid you adding fixed time sleeps that are bad for test durations (read more in the Await, do not make your E2E tests sleep article)\n\nno fights with test timeouts: tests have not timeouts, every single command has\n\nsuper neat and complete documentation, full of advice and best practices\n\nautomatic screenshot and videos on test failures\n\nthe Test Runner is astonishing\n\nyou do not need to slow down the browser to understand what's happening. The Test Runner reports everything and allows step-by-step navigation\n\nif something is not enough clear, a click on a step reports detailed info in the DevTools console\n\nyou can play/pause the test\n\ntracks every AJAX request\n\nunderstanding which test is running is easy\n\n\n\nsome more practical advantages like avoiding single Chrome instance and auto-close management, automatic page error reports, etc.\n\nlast but not least: you can leverage tens of Cypress plugins\n\n\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/why-is-e2e-testing-not-enough.html":{"url":"book/why-is-e2e-testing-not-enough.html","title":"Why is E2E testing not enough?","keywords":"","body":"Why is E2E testing not enough?\nE2E tests and UI integration tests give us high confidence about the whole application, so why should we write low-level tests? There are a couple of reasons:\n\nUI Integration Tests are fast but, more in general, Cypress is not. Cypress is fast if it's opened but if you need to run all the tests together you have to wait minutes, not seconds nor tenth of seconds\n\nso high-level tests can tell you what did not work but usually, they cannot tell you why. You know that an AJAX call has not started but why has not started?\n\nrendering the entire application is not always the best way to test something, a lot of parts are not related to the render phase at all, starting a real browser to test them is exaggerated\n\nthe end-user is probably the most important user of the application... But he/she is not the only one! All the components and the functions are consumed by the developer, not by the end-user. Every unit of the project has some APIs (its contract) and they need to be tested too. Testing an end-user flow does not allow you to replicate all the API cases\n\neverything is integrated to compose the final application, but you need to test littler integrations to have the confidence you need\n\n\nObviously, it all depends on the project size. A landing page could not need hundreds of different tests but a standard little/medium application needs them.\nAuthor: Stefano Magni\n"},"book/resources.html":{"url":"book/resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nCypress Docs\n\nE2E testing Best Practices\nRecipes\nRetry-ability\nThe Test Runner\nGitHub Integration\nNetwork Requests\nCode Coverage\n\nArticles\n\nStefano Magni: Test the request and response payloads\nKent C.
