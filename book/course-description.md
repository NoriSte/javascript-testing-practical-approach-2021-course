# Course description

### Javascript Testing, a Practical Approach

Being able to test web-apps and components is an increasingly important requirement for a front-end developer. There are tools and libraries that simplify the testing process but the learning curve can seem daunting.

> "What’s the right way to start testing my web applications?"

> "It’s unclear what I'm supposed to test (and what not) and how to do it"

> "My current tests fail all the time and don't help me preventing new bugs"

Does this sound familiar?

This course aims to provide basic information, principles and experience-based advices, to **enter the world of testing methodologies**.

Testing your own web applications is much easier and more profitable than you might think. Even if some advanced concepts and benefits may only become evident in the medium to long run this course serves the purpose to overcome the initial obstacles and understand how to take actions and leverage the benefits of testing **immediately** .

During the course, we will see all the useful tests for a web-app developed with React, dealing with the typical cases we encounter on a daily basis. During this course we will teach you:

- How to write effective end-to-end tests (E2E)
- How to test different user flows without a working back-end
- The best practices to follow to write useful and lasting tests
- How to integrate tests into development and Continuous Integration pipelines

We will alternate theoretical explanations with live coding sessions, all the exercises.

#### Tools

Since we don't follow the classic path but an inversed one (from E2E tests to unit test ones instead of the classic start-from-unit-tests one, you can read more about it in the [top to bottom](./top-to-bottom.md) page) we spend most of the time with Cypress. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is the best tools for 80% of the tests we run and we use it even for the last 20%, the unit tests, instead of adding other test runners for a bunch of tests.


#### Attendees

This course is for all the front-end developers, with some tests dedicated to React components, who have already worked with React but have not yet started, or have not yet succeeded in testing their React web applications. At the end of the course, you will be able to apply the fundamental principles of the test methodologies to understand what and how to test effectively.

#### Participation requirements

To participate it is necessary, or at least strongly recommended, that you already know the basic concepts behind JavaScript Promises and React.
