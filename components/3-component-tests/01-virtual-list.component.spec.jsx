/**
 * Main goals
 * - Test that the list renders only the visible items
 *
 * Additional goals
 * - Test that the list renders the right number of items even when if one of them is partially visible
 *
 * What to learn
 * - How to mount a component with Cypress
 * - The AAA pattern
 * - Pros and cons of high-level tests
 * - Pros and cons of low-level tests
 * - Low-level tests exploit good design choices but they are hard for the same reason
 *
 * What to think about
 * - We could need to mock node_modules dependencies with low-level tests
 *
 * Testing rules
 * - Different test types provide different feedback and have different cost
